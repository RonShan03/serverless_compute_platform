### Osiris Platform Detailed Technical Requirements

#### Overview
The Osiris platform will be a peer-to-peer style cluster where each container runs an instance of the same controller software. The platform will maintain a distributed ledger, similar to a blockchain, to keep track of all functions running across the cluster. Scaling decisions will be decentralized, with each controller capable of spawning new containers when needed.

#### 1. Architecture

1. **Peer-to-Peer Cluster**:
   - Each container runs an instance of the Osiris Controller.
   - Containers are peers and communicate with each other to maintain cluster state.

2. **Distributed Ledger**:
   - A blockchain-like ledger is maintained by each controller.
   - The ledger holds an index of all functions running on all containers.
   - Controllers synchronize their ledgers to ensure consistency.

3. **Decentralized Scaling**:
   - Each controller monitors resource usage and function backlogs.
   - Controllers can spawn new containers when reaching capacity thresholds.
   - Controllers can decide to run multiple instances of the same function if there is a backlog but the server is not at capacity.

#### 2. Osiris Controller

1. **Core Responsibilities**:
   - Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, etc.).
   - Maintain a copy of the distributed ledger.
   - Communicate with other controllers to synchronize the ledger.
   - Make scaling decisions based on resource usage and function backlogs.
   - Spawn new containers and assign functions to them.

2. **Components**:
   - **Resource Monitor**:
     - Tracks CPU, memory, and other resource usage.
     - Reports resource usage to the controller.
   - **Ledger Manager**:
     - Maintains the local copy of the distributed ledger.
     - Synchronizes the ledger with other controllers.
     - Adds new functions to the ledger when they start.
     - Removes functions from the ledger when they stop.
   - **Scaling Manager**:
     - Analyzes resource usage and backlog information.
     - Decides when to spawn new containers.
     - Coordinates with other controllers to balance the load.
   - **Function Manager**:
     - Starts, stops, and manages functions on the local container.
     - Reports function status to the ledger manager.

#### 3. Distributed Ledger

1. **Structure**:
   - The ledger is a blockchain-like structure where each block contains:
     - A list of functions running on a specific container.
     - A timestamp.
     - A cryptographic hash of the previous block.
   - Each controller maintains a full copy of the ledger.

2. **Synchronization**:
   - Controllers periodically synchronize their ledgers to ensure consistency.
   - New blocks are broadcast to all controllers in the cluster.
   - Consensus algorithm ensures that all controllers agree on the current state of the ledger.

3. **Operations**:
   - **Add Function**: When a new function starts, the controller adds a new block with the function details.
   - **Remove Function**: When a function stops, the controller adds a new block with the updated state.
   - **Verify Ledger**: Controllers verify the integrity of their ledgers using the cryptographic hashes.

#### 4. Decentralized Scaling

1. **Threshold Monitoring**:
   - Each controller monitors its resource usage and function backlogs.
   - Thresholds for CPU, memory, and other resources are configurable.
   - When a threshold is reached, the controller decides whether to scale.

2. **Scaling Decisions**:
   - Controllers can decide to:
     - Spawn a new container if the local container is at capacity.
     - Run additional instances of a function locally if there is a backlog but sufficient resources.
   - Scaling decisions are based on a combination of resource usage and function demand.

3. **Spawning New Containers**:
   - Controllers use Terraform to provision new containers on the cluster.
   - The new container is assigned functions based on the backlog and resource availability.
   - The new container joins the cluster and starts running the assigned functions.

#### 5. Communication Protocol

1. **Inter-Controller Communication**:
   - Controllers communicate using a peer-to-peer protocol.
   - Messages include ledger updates, scaling requests, and function status updates.
   - Controllers use a gossip protocol to propagate information efficiently.

2. **Security**:
   - Communication between controllers is encrypted.
   - Authentication ensures that only authorized controllers can join the cluster.
   - The ledger is protected by cryptographic hashes to prevent tampering.

### Detailed Components

#### Core Components

1. **Controller**
   - **Description:** The Controller is the master service responsible for managing function deployments, traffic routing, load balancing, and instance scaling.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Register and deregister functions.
     - Route incoming requests to the appropriate function instances.
     - Monitor function execution and system load.
     - Scale function instances up or down based on demand.
     - Maintain the in-memory index ledger of all running functions.

2. **CLI (Command Line Interface)**
   - **Description:** The CLI is a client-side tool for developers to manage the Osiris platform, including function deployment, monitoring, and scaling.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Deploy new functions to the platform.
     - Update or remove existing functions.
     - Retrieve logs and performance metrics.
     - Manage user roles and permissions.

3. **Client-SDK**
   - **Description:** The Client-SDK is a set of libraries that developers use to call Osiris functions from their applications. It handles serialization of function calls into API requests and deserialization of responses.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Look up functions by name.
     - Serialize function arguments into JSON.
     - Make API calls to the Controller.
     - Deserialize API responses into function return values.

4. **Function-SDK**
   - **Description:** The Function-SDK is used on the server side to handle incoming API requests, deserialize them into function calls, and serialize the return values into API responses.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Deserialize API requests into function arguments.
     - Invoke the appropriate function with the deserialized arguments.
     - Serialize function return values into JSON responses.

5. **Dockerfile**
   - **Description:** Dockerfiles describe the container images for deploying the Osiris platform and its functions.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Define the environment and dependencies for the Controller, function instances, and other components.
     - Ensure consistent and reproducible deployments across different environments.

6. **Terraform**
   - **Description:** Terraform scripts define the infrastructure needed to deploy Osiris on various cloud providers or on-premises environments.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Provision the necessary compute, storage, and networking resources.
     - Manage infrastructure as code for versioning and reproducibility.
     - Ensure cloud-agnostic deployment capabilities.

#### Key Data Stores

1. **Function Library**
   - **Description:** The function library is a repository of all functions written for the Osiris platform. These functions are stored as executables.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Store function code and metadata.
     - Provide versioning and rollback capabilities.
     - Serve function executables to instances as needed.

2. **Index Ledger**
   - **Description:** The index ledger is an in-memory data store that lists all functions running throughout the system. It is kept in sync across all servers.
   - **Responsibilities:**
     - Track the state and location of all running function instances.
     - Provide quick lookups for the Controller to route requests.
     - Synchronize state changes across all instances to ensure consistency.

### Workflow

1. **Function Deployment**
   - Developer writes a function and uses the CLI to deploy it to Osiris.
   - The function is registered with the Controller and stored in the function library.
   - The functionâ€™s metadata is added to the index ledger.

2. **Function Invocation**
   - A client application calls a function using the Client-SDK.
   - The Client-SDK serializes the request and sends it to the Controller.
   - The Controller routes the request to the appropriate function instance.
   - The Function-SDK on the server deserializes the request and invokes the function.
   - The function executes and returns a result.
   - The Function-SDK serializes the result and sends it back to the Controller.
   - The Controller sends the response back to the Client-SDK.
   - The Client-SDK deserializes the response and returns it to the calling application.

3. **Scaling and Load Management**
   - The Controller monitors function load and demand.
   - When demand increases, the Controller starts additional instances of the required functions.
   - When demand decreases, the Controller shuts down idle instances.
   - The index ledger is updated to reflect the current state of all function instances.

This matrix helps in understanding the interdependencies between different components, allowing us to specify APIs and protocols clearly to minimize integration issues.

For inter-component communication within the same device, there are alternative communication methods that can offer lower latency and be more efficient compared to network-based protocols like gRPC. Here are some potential methods to consider:

### Intra-Device Communication Methods

1. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Mechanisms**
   - **Shared Memory:**
     - **Pros:** Very fast as it involves direct memory access.
     - **Cons:** Requires careful synchronization to avoid race conditions.
   - **Sockets:**
     - **Pros:** Familiar API, can be used both for inter-process and network communication.
     - **Cons:** Still involves network stack overhead, though less than gRPC.
   - **Message Queues:**
     - **Pros:** Decouples sender and receiver, suitable for asynchronous communication.
     - **Cons:** Slightly higher overhead than shared memory.
   - **Pipes (Named Pipes/FIFOs):**
     - **Pros:** Simple and efficient for unidirectional data flow.
     - **Cons:** Less flexible, best for simple command/response patterns.

2. **Local Function Calls**
   - **Pros:** Direct and extremely fast, using the same processâ€™s memory.
   - **Cons:** Limited to components within the same application or service boundary.

3. **In-Memory Data Structures**
   - **Example:** Using in-memory databases like Redis when low latency and high throughput are required.
   - **Pros:** Very fast access, suitable for state sharing.
   - **Cons:** Overhead of maintaining the in-memory database, not as fast as direct memory access.

### Recommendations for Osiris

Given that Osiris will use gRPC for inter-device communication, here's a recommended approach for intra-device communication:

### 1. Shared Memory or Message Queues for Performance-Critical Paths

For components that require high-performance communication:
- Use **shared memory** for the fastest access.
- Ensure proper synchronization using semaphores or other locking mechanisms.
- Alternatively, use **message queues** for asynchronous communication needs.

### 2. Local Function Calls for Internal Module Communication

For communication within the same service or module:
- Direct **function calls** can be used where components are tightly coupled and reside within the same application boundary.

### 3. Pipes for Simple Command/Response

For simpler communication needs:
- Use **named pipes** for efficient unidirectional data flow between components.

### Example Use Cases in Osiris

#### Controller Communication
- **Within Controller (Core Logic and Scalability):**
  - Use shared memory for sharing state information.
  - Example: Shared memory segment for load balancing metrics.

#### CLI and Client SDK
- **CLI Commands to Controller:**
  - Use named pipes or local function calls for issuing commands.
  - Example: Named pipes for sending command requests to the controller.

#### Function SDK
- **Function Execution Coordination:**
  - Use message queues for coordinating function execution within the same device.
  - Example: Message queue for function request handling within the Function SDK.

- **P:** Pipes (Named Pipes)
- **F:** Function Calls

By using a mix of shared memory, named pipes, and local function calls for intra-device communication, Osiris can achieve high efficiency and low latency in scenarios where components reside on the same device. For inter-device

Here are the specifications for **Team 6: Client SDK Advanced Features**, written in the same LeetCode-style format. These advanced APIs add more complex functionality such as batched requests, retries, streaming, and real-time monitoring.

---

### API 1: Batch Function Calls Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `callFunctionBatch` API in the client SDK, which allows the client to invoke multiple functions in a single batch request.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def callFunctionBatch(function_calls: list) -> list:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `callFunctionBatch` API allows the client to batch multiple function calls into a single request.
- The input is a list of function call dictionaries, and the output is a list of results, one for each function invoked.

**Input:**
- `function_calls`: A list of dictionaries, each containing `function_name` and `args` for the function calls. (list of dict)

**Output:**
- A list of results, one for each function call.

**Sample Input:**
```python
function_calls = [
    {"function_name": "addNumbers", "args": [2, 3]},
    {"function_name": "multiplyNumbers", "args": [4, 5]}
]
response = callFunctionBatch(function_calls)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = [5, 20]
```

---

### API 2: Function Retry Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `retryFunctionCall` API in the client SDK, which retries a function call that failed due to temporary issues.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def retryFunctionCall(function_name: str, *args: list, retries: int = 3) -> any:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `retryFunctionCall` API retries the execution of a function if it fails due to temporary network or server issues.
- The function will be retried up to the specified number of times (`retries`).

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function to retry. (string)
- `args`: A list of arguments for the function. (list of any)
- `retries`: The number of times to retry the function (default is 3). (integer)

**Output:**
- The result of the function execution, or an error if all retries fail.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = retryFunctionCall("addNumbers", 1, 2, retries=3)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = 3
```

### API 3: Real-time Monitoring Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `enableRealTimeMonitoring` API in the client SDK, which enables real-time monitoring of function executions.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def enableRealTimeMonitoring() -> None:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `enableRealTimeMonitoring` API enables the client to receive real-time updates about function executions, resource usage, and other metrics.
- This is particularly useful for monitoring long-running or critical functions.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- None (real-time data will be streamed to the client as functions are executed).

**Sample Input:**
```python
enableRealTimeMonitoring()
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
# No output, but real-time data will be streamed to the client.
```

---

### API 4: Stream Function Output Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `streamFunctionOutput` API in the client SDK, which streams the output of a function in real-time as it is being executed.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def streamFunctionOutput(function_name: str, *args: list) -> Iterator:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `streamFunctionOutput` API streams the output of a function in real-time, allowing clients to process the data as it is generated.
- It returns an iterator, where each chunk of the output is yielded in real-time.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function to invoke. (string)
- `args`: A list of arguments for the function. (list of any)

**Output:**
- An iterator that yields chunks of the function output.

**Sample Input:**
```python
stream = streamFunctionOutput("generateLargeReport", report_type="summary")
for chunk in stream:
    print(chunk)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
"Processing report..."
"Fetching data..."
"Generating summary..."
```

---

### API 5: Function Call with Circuit Breaker Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `callFunctionWithCircuitBreaker` API in the client SDK, which adds a circuit breaker to prevent continuous retries of a failing function.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def callFunctionWithCircuitBreaker(function_name: str, *args: list, failure_threshold: int = 5) -> any:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `callFunctionWithCircuitBreaker` API invokes a function with a circuit breaker mechanism to prevent continuous retries if the function keeps failing.
- After `failure_threshold` failures, further attempts are blocked for a cooldown period.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function to invoke. (string)
- `args`: A list of arguments for the function. (list of any)
- `failure_threshold`: The number of failed attempts before the circuit breaker is triggered. (integer)

**Output:**
- The result of the function execution or an error if the circuit breaker is triggered.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = callFunctionWithCircuitBreaker("unreliableFunction", retries=3)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = "Circuit breaker triggered after 5 failed attempts"
```

---

### API 6: Cache Function Results Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `cacheFunctionResult` API in the client SDK, which caches the result of a function call for subsequent retrievals.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def cacheFunctionResult(function_name: str, *args: list, ttl: int = 300) -> any:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `cacheFunctionResult` API caches the result of a function call for a specified time-to-live (TTL) duration.
- Subsequent calls to the same function with the same arguments will return the cached result if it is still valid.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function whose result should be cached. (string)
- `args`: A list of arguments for the function. (list of any)
- `ttl`: The time-to-live (in seconds) for the cached result (default is 300 seconds). (integer)

**Output:**
- The result of the function call, from the cache if available, or freshly computed if not.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = cacheFunctionResult("addNumbers", 3, 5, ttl=600)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = 8  # From cache if called again within 600 seconds
```

---

### API 7: Invalidate Cache Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `invalidateCache` API in the client SDK, which invalidates the cached result of a function call.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def invalidateCache(function_name: str, *args: list) -> None:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `invalidateCache` API invalidates the cached result of a specific function call, forcing the function to be executed fresh on the next invocation.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function whose cache should be invalidated. (string)
- `args`: A list of arguments for the function call. (list of any)

**Output:**
- None

**Sample Input:**
```python
invalidateCache("addNumbers", 3, 5)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
# No output, but cache is invalidated for the specified function call.
```

---

### API 8: Aggregate Function Results Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `aggregateFunctionResults` API in the client SDK, which aggregates the results of multiple function calls into a single result.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def aggregateFunctionResults(function_calls: list) -> any:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `aggregateFunctionResults` API aggregates the results of multiple function calls into a single result. This is useful when multiple functions need to be executed, and their results combined in some way.

**Input:**
- `function_calls`: A list of dictionaries, each containing `function_name` and `args`. (list of dict)

**Output:**
- The aggregated result from the combined function calls.

**Sample Input:**
```python
function_calls = [
    {"function_name": "addNumbers", "args": [2, 3]},
    {"function_name": "multiplyNumbers", "args": [4, 5]}
]
result = aggregateFunctionResults(function_calls)
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
result = {"sum": 5, "product": 20}
```

---

### API 9: Parallel Function Execution Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `callFunctionsInParallel` API in the client SDK, which allows the client to invoke multiple functions in parallel.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def callFunctionsInParallel(function_calls: list) -> list:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `callFunctionsInParallel` API invokes multiple functions concurrently and returns their

Here are the specifications for **Team 13: Index Ledger Synchronization and Consistency**, written in the same LeetCode-style format. These APIs ensure that the distributed ledgers on the Osiris platform remain synchronized, consistent, and conflict-free across nodes and regions.

---

### API 1: Sync Ledger Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `syncLedger` API, which synchronizes the local ledger with other distributed ledgers to ensure consistency across all nodes.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def syncLedger() -> bool:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `syncLedger` API ensures that the local ledger is synchronized with the global ledger by pulling the latest transactions from other nodes or regions.
- The function returns `True` if synchronization is successful, `False` otherwise.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- `True` if the ledger is successfully synchronized, `False` otherwise.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = syncLedger()
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = True
```

### API 2: Detect Ledger Conflicts Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `detectLedgerConflicts` API, which identifies any conflicts in the ledger by comparing local transactions with transactions from other nodes.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def detectLedgerConflicts() -> list:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `detectLedgerConflicts` API scans the local ledger and compares it with distributed ledgers to detect any conflicts (e.g., duplicated or contradictory transactions).
- It returns a list of conflicts, with each conflict containing details about the conflicting transactions.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- A list of conflicts detected in the ledger, with each conflict containing transaction IDs and details of the discrepancies.

**Sample Input:**
```python
conflicts = detectLedgerConflicts()
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
conflicts = [
    {"transaction_id": "txn-123", "conflicting_transaction": "txn-999", "reason": "duplicate transaction"},
    {"transaction_id": "txn-124", "conflicting_transaction": "txn-1000", "reason": "mismatched amounts"}
]
```

### API 3: Resolve Ledger Conflict Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `resolveLedgerConflict` API, which resolves a specific ledger conflict based on the conflict resolution strategy.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def resolveLedgerConflict(transaction_id: str, resolution_strategy: str) -> bool:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `resolveLedgerConflict` API allows the user to resolve a specific conflict in the ledger by applying a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., "latest transaction wins", "merge amounts").
- The function returns `True` if the conflict is successfully resolved, `False` otherwise.

**Input:**
- `transaction_id`: The ID of the conflicting transaction. (string)
- `resolution_strategy`: The strategy to resolve the conflict (e.g., `"latest"`, `"merge"`, `"manual"`). (string)

**Output:**
- `True` if the conflict is successfully resolved, `False` otherwise.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = resolveLedgerConflict("txn-123", "latest")
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = True
```

### API 4: Broadcast Transaction to Nodes Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `broadcastTransaction` API, which broadcasts a newly recorded transaction to all nodes in the distributed ledger network.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def broadcastTransaction(transaction_id: str) -> bool:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `broadcastTransaction` API broadcasts a new transaction to all nodes in the network to ensure that all ledgers are updated consistently.
- The function returns `True` if the broadcast is successful, `False` otherwise.

**Input:**
- `transaction_id`: The ID of the transaction to broadcast. (string)

**Output:**
- `True` if the transaction is successfully broadcast, `False` otherwise.

**Sample Input:**
```python
response = broadcastTransaction("txn-125")
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
response = True
```

### API 5: Fetch Missing Transactions Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `fetchMissingTransactions` API, which pulls any missing transactions from other nodes to fill gaps in the local ledger.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def fetchMissingTransactions() -> list:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `fetchMissingTransactions` API compares the local ledger with other nodes and fetches any transactions that are missing locally but exist in the global ledger.
- It returns a list of transaction IDs that were fetched and added to the local ledger.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- A list of missing transaction IDs that were fetched and synced to the local ledger.

**Sample Input:**
```python
missing_transactions = fetchMissingTransactions()
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
missing_transactions = ["txn-126", "txn-127", "txn-128"]
```

---

### API 6: Monitor Ledger Sync Status Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `monitorLedgerSyncStatus` API, which provides real-time updates on the synchronization status of the ledger.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```python
def monitorLedgerSyncStatus() -> dict:
    pass
```

**Description:**
- The `monitorLedgerSyncStatus` API monitors the current status of ledger synchronization across nodes, providing real-time information on sync progress and issues.
- It returns a dictionary containing the sync status, percentage completion, and any errors encountered during the sync process.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- A dictionary containing the sync status, progress percentage, and error details (if any).

**Sample Input:**
```python
sync_status = monitorLedgerSyncStatus()
```

**Sample Output:**
```python
sync_status = {
    "status": "syncing",
    "progress": 85,
    "errors": []
}

**Function Signature:**
```python
def forceLedgerReconciliation() -> bool:
    pass

These specifications handle the synchronization and consistency management of a distributed ledger system, ensuring that all nodes maintain consistent and conflict-free records across the Osiris platform. The APIs also allow for detecting, resolving, and monitoring ledger conflicts and sync statuses.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris deploy ./functions/add_numbers.py --name addNumbers --runtime python3.8
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
Function "addNumbers" deployed successfully.

**Output:**
- A success or failure message indicating whether the function was successfully updated.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris update addNumbers ./functions/add_numbers_v2.py
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
Function "addNumbers" updated successfully.
```

Implement the `osiris remove` CLI command, which removes a deployed function from the Osiris platform.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```bash
osiris remove <function_name>
```

**Description:**
- The `remove` command is used to remove a previously deployed function from the Osiris platform.
- It takes the function name as input and unregisters it from the system.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function to be removed. (string)

**Output:**
- A success or failure message indicating whether the function was successfully removed.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris remove addNumbers
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
Function "addNumbers" removed successfully.
```

---

### API 4: List Functions Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `osiris list` CLI command, which lists all functions currently deployed on the Osiris platform.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```bash
osiris list
```

**Description:**
- The `list` command retrieves and displays all deployed functions currently active on the Osiris platform.
- It returns the function name, runtime, and status for each function.

**Input:**
- None

**Output:**
- A list of all deployed functions and their statuses.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris list
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
Deployed Functions:
1. Function Name: addNumbers, Runtime: Python 3.8, Status: running
2. Function Name: subtractNumbers, Runtime: Node.js, Status: running
```

---

### API 5: Describe Function Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `osiris describe` CLI command, which provides detailed information about a specific function deployed on the Osiris platform.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```bash
osiris describe <function_name>
```

**Description:**
- The `describe` command gives detailed information about a deployed function, such as its runtime, parameters, and current status.
- It takes the function name as input and returns all relevant metadata.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function to be described. (string)

**Output:**
- Detailed information about the function, including runtime, status, and deployment details.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris describe addNumbers
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
Function Name: addNumbers
Runtime: Python 3.8
Status: running
Deployed At: 2024-10-20
```

---

### API 6: Get Logs Command

**Problem:**
Implement the `osiris logs` CLI command, which retrieves the logs of a specific function deployed on the Osiris platform.

**Type:** Function

**Function Signature:**
```bash
osiris logs <function_name> --tail
```

**Description:**
- The `logs` command retrieves the execution logs of a specific function.
- The `--tail` option allows viewing the most recent logs.

**Input:**
- `function_name`: The name of the function whose logs are being retrieved. (string)
- `--tail`: Optional flag to retrieve the most recent logs. (boolean)

**Output:**
- Logs of the specified function.

**Sample Input:**
```bash
osiris logs addNumbers --tail
```

**Sample Output:**
```bash
2024-10-20 12:00:00 - Function started with inputs: 3, 5
2024-10-20 12:00:01 - Function executed successfully. Result: 8
```

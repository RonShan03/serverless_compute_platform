To break down the Osiris project into 16 self-contained sub-projects for small cross-functional teams, we can indeed split larger components into smaller sub-projects and introduce additional scope for comprehensive functionality. Here is an organized list of 16 sub-projects, ensuring each team has clear and manageable tasks.

### Proposed Team Structure

- **Team 1:** Controller Core Logic
- **Team 2:** Controller Scalability and Load Balancing
- **Team 3:** CLI Core Commands
- **Team 4:** CLI User Management and Permissions
- **Team 5:** Client SDK Core Functionality
- **Team 6:** Client SDK Advanced Features
- **Team 7:** Function SDK Core Logic
- **Team 8:** Docker Configuration and Management
- **Team 9:** Terraform Scripts and Infrastructure Management
- **Team 10:** Function Library Core Management
- **Team 11:** Function Versioning and Rollback
- **Team 12:** Index Ledger Core Implementation
- **Team 13:** Index Ledger Synchronization and Consistency
- **Team 14:** Admin Portal Core Features
- **Team 15:** Admin Portal Advanced Features
- **Team 16:** Code Generation from Natural Language

Each team will also be responsible for integration and testing within their respective domains, ensuring that all components fit together seamlessly to create a fully functional prototype of the Osiris platform.

The proposed team structure aims to distribute the work as evenly as possible among the 16 teams, but the nature and complexity of each sub-project can vary. Let's analyze the distribution and complexity of the work for each team:

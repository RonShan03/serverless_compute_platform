### Summary

By breaking down the larger components into smaller sub-projects and adding additional scope, we can create 16 self-contained projects that align with your organizational goals. This approach ensures that each team is accountable for a specific "lego brick" of the Osiris platform, facilitating clear responsibilities, efficient management, and effective integration of the overall project.

### Proposed Team Structure

- **Team 1:** Controller Core Logic
- **Team 2:** Controller Scalability and Load Balancing
- **Team 3:** CLI Core Commands
- **Team 4:** CLI User Management and Permissions
- **Team 5:** Client SDK Core Functionality
- **Team 6:** Client SDK Advanced Features
- **Team 7:** Function SDK Core Logic

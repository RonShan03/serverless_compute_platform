### Registration and Authentication Proposal with Federated IAM Integration

#### Overview

To maintain cloud agnosticism and provide a flexible, secure registration and authentication system, the platform will integrate with federated authentication and IAM. This approach allows for seamless integration with various cloud providers and on-premises solutions. Additionally, a separate add-on will be offered for the SaaS use-case, providing self-service registration and simplified management.

#### Key Components

1. **Federated Authentication and IAM Integration**
   - **Adapters for Cloud Providers:** Build adapters for AWS IAM, Azure AD, Google Cloud IAM, and other popular identity providers.
   - **On-Premises Solutions:** Support integration with corporate directories such as LDAP or Active Directory.
   - **Single Sign-On (SSO):** Enable SSO capabilities to allow users to authenticate through their organization's existing identity provider.

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - **Centralized Role Management:** Utilize federated IAM to manage roles and permissions centrally.
   - **Custom Roles and Policies:** Allow administrators to define custom roles and policies tailored to their organization's needs.
   - **Auditing and Compliance:** Ensure robust auditing capabilities to track access and changes, supporting compliance requirements.

3. **SaaS Add-On for Self-Service Registration**
   - **User Registration Portal:** Develop a self-service registration portal for users subscribing to the platform as a service.
   - **Subscription Management:** Integrate with billing and subscription management systems to handle user subscriptions and payments.
   - **Default Permissions and Role Upgrades:** Assign default permissions to new users, with options for requesting role upgrades and additional access.

### Implementation Details

#### Federated IAM Integration

1. **Adapter Development**
   - **Cloud Adapters:** Build and maintain adapters for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to interface with their IAM services.
   - **On-Premises Adapters:** Develop connectors for popular on-premises identity solutions like LDAP and Active Directory.

2. **Federated Authentication**
   - **SSO Implementation:** Implement SSO to support authentication through existing corporate identity providers.
   - **OAuth2 and OpenID Connect:** Utilize OAuth2 and OpenID Connect protocols for secure authentication and authorization.

3. **RBAC and Policy Management**
   - **Centralized Role Management:** Integrate with IAM services to centralize role and policy management.
   - **Custom Role Definitions:** Allow administrators to create and assign custom roles and policies.
   - **Compliance and Auditing:** Implement logging and auditing features to ensure compliance and track access changes.

#### SaaS Add-On for Self-Service Registration

1. **User Registration Portal**
   - **Sign-Up Workflow:** Develop a streamlined sign-up process with email verification and two-factor authentication (2FA).
   - **User Dashboard:** Provide a user dashboard for managing profiles, roles, and subscription status.

2. **Subscription Management**
   - **Billing Integration:** Integrate with payment gateways to handle billing and subscription payments.
   - **Subscription Plans:** Offer various subscription plans with different levels of access and features.

3. **Role and Permission Management**
   - **Default Permissions:** Assign default permissions to new users upon registration.
   - **Role Upgrade Requests:** Allow users to request role upgrades and additional permissions, subject to administrator approval.

### User Registration Workflow (Administrator-Provisioned Model)

1. **Access Request Submission:**
   - Users submit access requests through a dedicated portal, providing necessary details and justifications.

2. **Administrator Review:**
   - System administrators review and approve or deny the requests.

3. **Account Creation:**
   - Approved requests lead to account creation with appropriate roles and permissions.

4. **Onboarding:**
   - New users receive onboarding documentation and training resources.

### Summary

By integrating federated authentication and IAM, we ensure a secure, flexible, and cloud-agnostic registration and authentication process. The SaaS add-on provides a convenient self-service registration option for users subscribing to the platform, while the administrator-provisioned model offers tight control for more secure environments. This dual approach ensures that our platform meets diverse user needs and deployment scenarios, enhancing its appeal and usability.
